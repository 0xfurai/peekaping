# Peekaping üöÄ

**A modern, self-hosted uptime monitoring solution**

Peekaping is a powerful, feature-rich uptime monitoring system similar to Uptime Kuma, built with Go and React. Monitor your websites, APIs, and services with real-time notifications, beautiful status pages, and comprehensive analytics.

## Motivation

Peekaping is designed as a modern alternative to Uptime Kuma, built with a focus on **strongly typed architecture** and **extensibility**. Our server is written in Go, a fast and efficient language that enables a small footprint while maintaining high performance. The codebase is structured for easy extensibility, allowing developers to seamlessly add new notification channels, monitor types, and even swap out the database layer without major refactoring.

The client-side application is also strongly typed and built with modern React patterns, making it equally extensible and maintainable. This combination of type safety, performance, and modular design makes Peekaping an ideal choice for teams who need a reliable, customizable uptime monitoring solution.
