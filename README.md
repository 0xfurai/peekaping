## üí° Motivation behind creating uptime kuma alternative

Peekaping was deeply inspired by Uptime Kuma. We tried to cover all the fundamental flaws of Uptime Kuma. Alternative was to build new system with features community love and request but using typed approaches applying extendable architecture. First of all - we are API first. Our server side written in Golang, fast and efficient language that works with minimal RAM. Architecture allows easily extend system adding new notification channels, monitor types etc.

Client side written with React and typescript that makes it reliable and fast. Client side is also easily extensible.

Peekaping an ideal choice for teams who need a reliable, customizable uptime monitoring solution.
