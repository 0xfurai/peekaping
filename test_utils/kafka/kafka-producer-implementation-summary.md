# Kafka Producer Monitor Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the kafka-producer monitor type for the Peekaping monitoring application.

## Overview

The kafka-producer monitor type allows monitoring of Kafka clusters by attempting to produce messages to specified topics. This implementation follows the existing patterns in the codebase and includes both server-side and client-side components.

## Server-Side Implementation

### 1. Kafka Producer Executor (`apps/server/internal/modules/healthcheck/executor/kafka_producer.go`)

**Key Features:**
- Implements the `Executor` interface with `Execute`, `Validate`, and `Unmarshal` methods
- Uses IBM Sarama Kafka client library for robust Kafka connectivity
- Supports multiple brokers for high availability
- Comprehensive SSL/TLS and SASL authentication support
- Proper timeout handling and error reporting
- Graceful connection management with cleanup

**Configuration Options:**
- `brokers`: Array of Kafka broker addresses (host:port format)
- `topic`: Target topic for message production
- `message`: Message content to send (supports JSON)
- `allow_auto_topic_creation`: Whether to auto-create topics
- `ssl`: Enable SSL/TLS encryption
- `sasl_options`: Authentication configuration
  - `mechanism`: PLAIN, SCRAM-SHA-256, SCRAM-SHA-512, or None
  - `username`: SASL username
  - `password`: SASL password

**Error Handling:**
- Connection failures
- Authentication errors
- Message send timeouts
- Topic creation issues
- Network connectivity problems

### 2. Executor Registration (`apps/server/internal/modules/healthcheck/executor/executor.go`)

- Added `kafka-producer` to the executor registry
- Instantiates `NewKafkaProducerExecutor` with logger dependency

### 3. Dependencies (`apps/server/go.mod`)

- Added `github.com/IBM/sarama v1.43.3` for Kafka client functionality
- Includes all necessary transitive dependencies

## Client-Side Implementation

### 1. Schema Definition (`apps/web/src/app/monitors/components/kafka-producer/schema.ts`)

**Features:**
- Zod schema validation for type safety
- Proper TypeScript types for form handling
- Serialization/deserialization functions for API communication
- Default values for new monitor creation

**Form Fields:**
- Brokers list management
- Topic configuration
- Message content (with JSON support)
- Security settings (SSL, SASL)
- Standard monitor fields (intervals, notifications, etc.)

### 2. React Component (`apps/web/src/app/monitors/components/kafka-producer/index.tsx`)

**Features:**
- Modern React functional component with hooks
- Dynamic broker list management (add/remove)
- Conditional SASL authentication fields
- Form validation and error handling
- Consistent UI/UX with existing monitor types

**UI Components:**
- Broker address inputs with add/remove functionality
- Topic and message configuration
- SSL/TLS toggle
- SASL mechanism dropdown with conditional username/password fields
- Standard monitor configuration cards (intervals, notifications, tags, proxies)

### 3. Registry Integration (`apps/web/src/app/monitors/components/monitor-registry.ts`)

- Added kafka-producer to the monitor type registry
- Includes deserialize function and React component
- Enables automatic form handling and monitor cloning

### 4. Form Context Integration (`apps/web/src/app/monitors/context/monitor-form-context.tsx`)

- Added KafkaProducerForm to the discriminated union type
- Includes schema in form validation
- Enables seamless form state management

### 5. Monitor Type Selection (`apps/web/src/app/monitors/components/shared/general.tsx`)

- Added "Kafka Producer Monitor" option to the monitor type dropdown
- Consistent with existing monitor type descriptions

## Testing

### Server-Side
- Kafka executor module builds successfully
- Dependencies resolve correctly
- Follows existing patterns for error handling and logging

### Client-Side
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- React components integrate properly with existing form system
- UI components follow established design patterns

## Usage

1. **Creating a Kafka Producer Monitor:**
   - Select "Kafka Producer Monitor" from the monitor type dropdown
   - Configure one or more Kafka broker addresses
   - Specify the target topic and message content
   - Configure security settings if needed (SSL, SASL)
   - Set monitoring intervals and notification preferences

2. **Monitor Execution:**
   - Connects to specified Kafka brokers
   - Attempts to produce the configured message to the topic
   - Reports success/failure with detailed error messages
   - Tracks response times and connection status

3. **Error Scenarios:**
   - Broker connectivity issues
   - Authentication failures
   - Topic access problems
   - Message production timeouts

## Benefits

- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Tests actual Kafka connectivity and message production
- **Security Support**: Full SSL/TLS and SASL authentication coverage
- **High Availability**: Multi-broker support for redundancy
- **User-Friendly**: Intuitive UI matching existing monitor types
- **Robust Error Handling**: Detailed error reporting for troubleshooting
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage for reliability

## Implementation Notes

- Follows established codebase patterns for consistency
- Uses proven libraries (IBM Sarama for Go, React Hook Form for frontend)
- Implements proper validation at both client and server levels
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing monitor system
- Includes comprehensive error handling and logging
